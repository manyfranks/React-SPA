## ⚠️ Known Considerations

### 1. Large Video File
**File:** `public/videos/ironvideo2.mp4` (54 MB)

**Status:** Successfully pushed, but exceeds GitHub's recommended 50 MB limit.

**Options:**
- ✅ **Keep as-is:** File works, just a warning
- 🔄 **Compress video:** Reduce file size to <50 MB
- ☁️ **Use CDN:** Host video externally (Cloudinary, AWS S3)
- 🎬 **Use streaming:** Convert to HLS/DASH for better performance

**Recommendation:** Monitor video load times on deployed site. If slow, consider compression or CDN.

### 2. Development Routes
The following routes are development/testing pages:
- `/about-dev`, `/hero-dev`, `/landingpage-dev`, etc.

**Options:**
- Keep for A/B testing
- Remove before production launch
- Add to robots.txt to prevent indexing

## 📊 Expected Performance

Based on local build testing:

| Metric | Target | Expected |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Lighthouse Performance** | 90+ | 90-95 |
| **First Contentful Paint** | <2s | 1.5-2s |
| **Time to Interactive** | <3s | 2-3s |
| **Total Bundle Size** | <200 kB | 87.6 kB ✅ |
| **Pages Pre-rendered** | All | 27/27 ✅ |

---

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Once connected, every push to `main` branch will:

1. ✅ Trigger automatic build on Vercel
2. ✅ Run `npm install` and `next build`
3. ✅ Deploy to production if build succeeds
4. ✅ Provide deployment URL and logs
5. ✅ Enable instant rollback if needed

**Preview Deployments:** Every pull request will get its own preview URL for testing before merge.
