# Developer Handoff Summary: IIC Environmental Website Revitalization

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the extensive work performed to revitalize an old client website, originally built with Create React App (CRA). The initial goal was to make minor revisions, but this evolved into a full-scale architectural migration to Next.js 14 to meet modern web standards, improve SEO, and support the client's new multi-page content requirements.

The project is now stable, feature-complete based on the new requirements, and has passed a comprehensive QA audit.

## 2. Key Accomplishments & Architectural Changes

### Step 1: Initial Project Revival (CRA)
- **Problem:** The old CRA project failed to start due to a Node.js v17+ OpenSSL conflict (`ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`).
- **Solution:** The `dev` script in `package.json` was temporarily modified with the `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag to get the development server running for initial assessment.

### Step 2: Full Stack Upgrade & Next.js Migration
- **Motivation:** The OpenSSL fix was not viable for production/Vercel, which requires modern Node.js versions (22+). A decision was made to migrate to Next.js to support the client's request for a multi-page, SEO-friendly site.
- **Actions:**
    - **Removed Create React App:** All `react-scripts` and related dependencies were removed.
    - **Installed Next.js 14:** The project was re-scaffolded using the Next.js `app` router paradigm.
    - **Upgraded React:** Migrated from React 17 to React 18, updating the root rendering API.
    - **File Structure:** All components and pages were moved from the `src/` directory to the `app/` directory (`app/src/` for components, `app/[page]/` for routes).

### Step 3: Architecture & Best Practices Implementation
- **SSR Styling:** Encountered and fixed an issue where `styled-components` styles did not apply on server-side render.
    - **Solution:** Implemented a `StyledComponentsRegistry` (`app/src/lib/registry.js`) as per Next.js best practices to correctly collect and inject styles on the server.
- **Consistent Layouts:** Ensured a consistent look and feel across all pages.
    - **Solution:** Created a global `LayoutWrapper` in `app/layout.js` to render the `Navbar` and `Footer` on every page.
- **Consistent Theming:** New pages were initially appearing with a "light mode" theme, breaking visual consistency.
    - **Solution:** Created a reusable `PageSection` component (`app/src/components/PageSection`) that accepts a `theme='dark'` or `theme='light'` prop to enforce the site's dark theme across all new pages.
- **Routing:**
    - Replaced `react-router-dom` and `react-scroll` with the Next.js App Router's file-based routing and the `<Link>` component.
    - Implemented dynamic routing for 11 individual service pages using `app/services/[serviceId]/page.js`.

### Step 4: Content & Feature Implementation
- **New Pages Created:**
    - `/services`: A hub page listing all 11 services.
    - `/services/[serviceId]`: 11 dynamic, statically generated pages for each service.
    - `/about`: Company profile and leadership bios.
    - `/team`: Corporate profiles.
    - `/contact`: New contact page with a functional API route (`app/api/contact/route.js`) for form submissions.
- **Landing Page Updates:**
    - **"Our Services" Section:** Dynamically populates with all 11 services, linking to their detail pages.
    - **"Our Partners" Section:** Updated with a new logo marquee.

### Step 5: QA & Bug Fixes
A comprehensive, end-to-end audit was performed.
- **Critical Fixes:**
    - **Navigation:** Corrected multiple broken links in the `Navbar` and `Sidebar` that were pointing to non-existent routes (e.g., `/company` -> `/about`).
    - **Contact Form Validation:** Added the `noValidate` attribute to the form to disable default browser validation and enforce the more robust custom regex validation, fixing a bug where invalid emails were accepted.
- **Current Status:** The site is stable and free of blocking bugs. A minor, non-blocking `styled-components` hydration warning remains in the console but does not affect functionality.
